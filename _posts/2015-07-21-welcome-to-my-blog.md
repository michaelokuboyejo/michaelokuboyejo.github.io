title: Welcome to my blog
---

So I must say that this is my second attempt at blogging, and this is one I really hope to commit myself to. I hope to share my thoughts, ideas and projects - one way to give back to the online community.

So Why blog ?
-------------
Well this is a channel, an online voice and a platform to reach people. There are thousands (literally though) of blogs in existence already but with this one i hope to:

 > - Share ideas, belief systems and thoughts
 > - Document my techy adventures and hopefully give tips to help others. 
 
 
 First Thought
 --------------
 ------------
 
 	I would regularly write ( frequency : not yet decided ) about technology and how I am contributing to the tech-space.
 
	With all that's going on in technology, what are you doing to contribute to the industry ? And how are you changing the world ?
 	Let's not just talk about technology, let's also create technology and make the world a better place.

 Here's to the beginning of greater things.
