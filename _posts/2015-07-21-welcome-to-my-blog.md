So i must say that this is my second attempt at blogging, and this is one i really hope to commit myself to. I hope to share my thoughts, ideas and projects - one way to give back to the online community.

So Why blog ?

 HOW TO ?
 -------
 
 So, the source code to my website is on [Github](https://github.com/michaelokuboyejo/michaelokuboyejo.github.io). I must say that [Udinic's](http://blog.udinic.com/2015/06/04/yet-another-blog-setup-post) blogpost really helped me in setting this website up. I too had considered Wordpress and other CMS options and was already bulding until i stumbled on his post. I settled for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Yeah, this Website was built using Jekyll. I used the [Hyde](http://hyde.com) theme created by [@mydo](http://twitter.com/mydo). I did some customization in CSS and tada! here we are.
 Comments are powered by [Disqus](http://disqus). 
 
 Publishing ?
 ------------
 
 I write posts in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and I **git push** to publish.
 Cool right ?
 With some help from [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) , I was able to do a few other things.
