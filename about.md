> I am **Michael Okuboyejo.** 

Bsc. Electronics and Electrical Engineering (in view) , Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife **Great Ife** . I am passionate about technology. My interests span from **Software ( Mobile and Web Applications ) Development** to **Robotics** and **Artificial Intelligence** to **Data Science** and the **Internet of Things**. I am not just interested in creating technology, but in getting it to the hands of the user ( who does not have to know how it works )
